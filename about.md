I am a PhD student in the department of <a href="http://www.polymtl.ca/gigl/" target="_blank">Computer Engineering at Ecole Polytechnique</a> in Montreal, Canada, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.professeurs.polymtl.ca/michel.desmarais/desmarais_michel_c.html" target="_blank">Michel Desmarais</a>. My research is focused on developing tools for teachers to find structure and pedagogical insight in the bodies of natural language texts produced by their students.

I have been a physics teacher at <a href="http://www.dawsoncollege.qc.ca/" target="_blank">Dawson College</a> since 2009. I joined the SALTISE <a href="https://dianaramsey1981.wordpress.com/chris-whittaker/" target="_blank">Physics education research group</a>, wherein I worked on the development and deployment of DALITE, a web-based learning environment centered on delivering peer instruction on-line.
